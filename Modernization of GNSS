Modernization of GNSS
New civil, military and governmental user capabilities and performance, including availability and accuracy improvement concepts. GNSS services including open and authorized services, search and rescue services, and commercial services; optimization of GNSS signal structure, codes and data message; radio-frequency compatibility and interoperability among different systems; concepts for interchangeability of GNSS constellations; analysis of system performance, mutual interference, impact on noise floor; tools for assessment of RF compatibility and GNSS signal simulators. Other topics may include frequency coordination and protection issues; spectrum management and policy; modernized constellations characteristics and programmatic aspects, ground control and monitoring segments; performance analysis of new satellites; user equipment architecture and design; integration with regional augmentation systems and use of those new systems to support future applications.
