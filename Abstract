We consider extending the sets of L2C and L5 message types by defining two new message types: message type 38 with SV clock correction parameter content and 149-bit binary payload and message type 28 containing a 238-bit binary payload. Incorporating these two new message types could allow for additional capability within L2C and L5, e.g. distress alerting satellite system (DASS) and signal authentication.  Our objectives are two fold, the first objective is to fully utilize and optimize the civil navigation (CNAV) signals (i.e. L2C and L5) bandwidth for GNSS services, the second objective is to maintain the established messaging broadcast intervals for the existing message types defined in IS-200 table 30-XII and IS-705 table 20-XII.  

Each document, IS-200 and IS-705, state that the "Broadcast system of messages is completely arbitrary, but sequenced to provide optimum user performance."  In order to fulfill optimum user performance and fulfill our objectives above, we model the message sequencing problem into two family of linear programming (LP) problems.  The first family of LP problems' objective is to quantify the maximal number of messaging types 28 and 38 while observing the established messaging broadcast intervals as linear constraints.  The solution of the first family of LP problems yields the quantity of each message type considered in the problem, i.e. message type 28, 38, ephemeris types, SV clock correction message types, etc.  The second family of LP problems' objective is to find a messaging sequence which maximizes the number of message type 28 and 38 while observing the established messaging broadcast intervals as linear constraints.  The difference between the first family and the second family  of problems is that the first family does not find a message sequence with the quantified maximal number of messaging types 28 and 38 while observing the established messaging broadcast intervals as linear constraints nor does the first family guarentee that such a sequence with  the quantified maximal number of messaging types 28 and 38 while observing the established messaging broadcast intervals as linear constraints exists.  The second family of problems finds a message sequence which maximizes the number of message type 28 and 38 while observing the established messaging broadcast intervals as linear constraints. 

In this paper, we model the established messaging broadcast intervals as linear constraints for each family of LP problems. We anticipate
